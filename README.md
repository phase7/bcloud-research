At first we are getting hands dirty with postgresql on local machine.

## Installation
Check out my [postgres installation overview](https://github.com/phase7/bcloud-research/blob/phase7-install-postgres/install-postgres-manjaro.md) to see how I installed on Manjaro.

## Postgres Shell
We can get into the shell by executing psql command. We will likely see our default user name. in this shell we can run the following commands to inspect database and execute  tasks. Below we will look at some of the most useful commands of postgres command line tool. (will update as I go on)

| Commands  | What they do                                                |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| \q        | quit psql                                                   |
| \i FILE   | execute commands from file                                  |
| \d        | list tables, views, and sequences                           |
| \d TABLENAME| Show table schema and other details of `TABLENAME` table                                  |
| \l        | list databases                                              |
| \c DBNAME | connect to new database DBNAME (currently default username) |
| \x        | Expand view; To see long table records in a beautiful manner|
| \df        | View available functions; like uuid generation.|

## Basic SQL (common operations and keywords)

Following are some basic sql commands for beginners. (will update as I go on)

### Examples

|              Operation             |                                       Query                                      |                                                    What you should know about them                                                   |
|:----------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Count all unique values            | SELECT   col_name ,  COUNT (*)  FROM  tablename  GROUP BY   col_name ;           | `COUNT(*)` calculates all occurances of a value. You can use `GROUP BY` to select a row where you want to execute this operation on. |
| Same as above, but with conditions | SELECT col_name, COUNT(*) FROM tablename GROUP BY col_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 10; | `HAVING` keyword is somewhat same as `WHERE`, it can help set conditions                                                             |

### Difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`
 | Where                                                        | Having                                                       |
   | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **`WHERE` selects input rows before groups and aggregates are computed** | **`HAVING` selects group rows after groups and aggregates are computed** |
   | `WHERE` clause must not contain aggregate functions          | `HAVING` clause contains aggregate functions most of the time |
   | You can use `WHERE` without group by clause.                 | You cannot use `HAVING` without group by clause.             |

| Inner join, get the common result                    | `SELECT * FROM person JOIN car ON person.car_id=car.id;` | merge two tables based on the condition and get only the common result(s)                  |
| Left join, get the common plus all of the left table | SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN car using(car_uid)      | In this join you'll get all inner join results with the complete left table you have joined. |

## Date and Time  on Postgres
For date and time operations, the `NOW()` function is widely used. Examples given below.

```sql
SELECT NOW();         # 2020-08-13 21:16:10.665998+06
SELECT NOW()::DATE;   # 2020-08-13
SELECT NOW()::TIME;   # 21:17:09.700756
```
We can process this data further.

| Operation                          | Function                                                                                                | Output                                |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Subtract specific time from now    | SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '2 YEAR 1 MONTH';                                                               | 2018-07-13 22:14:21.165973+06         |
| Add specific time to now           | SELECT (NOW() - INTERVAL '2 YEAR 1 MONTH')::DATE;                                                       | 2018-07-13                            |
| Get specific field using `EXTRACT` | SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR from NOW()); SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH from NOW()); SELECT EXTRACT(CENTURY from NOW());  | 2020 8 21                             |
| Calculate age                      | SELECT AGE(NOW(), DATE '2007-7-7') AS age;                                                              | 13 years 1 mon 6 days 22:18:32.906531 |

## Export Query Results to a CSV File

We can take the output of a query and save it as a CSV file. We'll use the following command.

```sql
\copy (SELECT * FROM tablename) TO '/path/to/csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

By changing the delimiter we can produce tsv as well.

## Extensions

Extensions can add additional functionalities. We can use `uuid`s by using an extension.

```sql
select * from pg_available_extensions where name like '%uuid%';
```
We get `uuid-ossp`.


We can check all of the extensions available in PostgreSQL by using:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;
```

To install an extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```
We have to run it as the superuser. Otherwise we will face errors. So I have changed my role as superuser.
```sql
ALTER USER <your-user-name> WITH SUPERUSER;
```

Now we can see available functions by writing `\df`.
